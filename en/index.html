                            Squats Archive is an online archive of squats evicted by city.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project’s principal aim is to provide the necessary data and evidence to denounce evictions of occupied places for motives qualified as “urgent”, and whose supposed projects never come about. We also aim to ... to these places and the initatives that they harbored (?). Finally, we hope this tool will serve to present squatting culture in its historical dimension.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project is collaborative and autonomous. Squats Archive aims to present numerous maps, all of which will be managed by local collectives established in each city.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project owes its existence to the London Squats Archive.

                                <p>
                                    The squats are living spaces and we do not wish to expose them. Our objective is to constitute an archive that takes into account the past, and not the present.

                                    The local collective for that corresponding city includes squats online according to their own criterion. The collective is responsible for the data included on their map.

                                <p>
                                    It is important for squats, and squatters to be protected. The collective holds the entire responsibility of what it chooses to publish.

                                    Considering Squats Archive’s aim, we want to put forward information concerning legal procedures, and activities that took place in the squats. However, the number of categories is deliberately limited in order to protect the squats and their inhabitants.

                            *Un collectif de squatters militants ayant fait l’expérience, et ayant été témoins, de nombreuses expulsions (tant “légales” que “illégales”) pour motifs “urgents”. Parmi ces motifs figurent « l’urgence » pour le « début de travaux » qui ne sont jamais entamés, ou pour « des projets » qui ne verront jamais le jour mais qui permettent le monopole des institutions publiques, entre autres, sur des lieux vides, pendant qu’aucune solution concrète officielle n’est apportée aux victimes de problèmes de logement. Au-delà du squat dit « d’habitation » des membres de notre collectif ont respectivement été à l’origine, ou ont fait partie, d’initiatives sociales, culturelles et/ou politiques, au sein de leurs lieux.

                                Archive work has to be undertaken over a period of time, so think about it from the start, and gather a group of motivated people together!

                        <h3>Creating an e-mail address:</h3>
                            <p>
                                It’s via your e-mail that people will be able to send you info on squats that you can add. It’s also via your e-mail that we (Squats Archive) will be getting in touch with you. We suggest that you request an e-mail address from riseup.net, and create it according to the following format:

                                *yourcity*squatsarchive@riseup.net (e.g. lyonsquatsarchive@riseup.net)

                            <p>
                                We do not stock information squats in different cities. Instead, we use <a href="http://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a>, which is something you can also do. Create a free acount (*yourcity*squatsarchive) with your new e-mail address, and then go to “create a new table” that you can name “evicted_squats_*yourcity*”, and import [...?] so that your database is nicely formatted. 
                            </p>
                        <h3>Send us an e-mail with your info and we’ll add you:</h3>
                            <p>
                                To add your city, and to link the page to your database, we need some of the following information from you: e-mail address; city; CartoDB username; name of the table. Send us all that on: <a href="mailto:squatsarchive@riseup.net">squatsarchive@riseup.net</a>.
                            </p>

                        <h3>Manage your data autonomously on CartoDB:</h3>
                            <p>
                                There you go, you no longer need us! You can now add squats in your city to your map via your CartoDB account by using their interface. We’ll take care of collecting that data and make sure it’s displayed nice and neatly!
                            </p>

                        <h3>BEWARE !</h3>
                            <p>
                                If you add columns (for categories) in CartoDB then what you include in them will not be displayed. We suggest that you do not include sensitive information in your database, as all information will be publicly accessible via the raw data! As usual: do-it-yourself! And be careful !

                                Before the data is published we will check to ensure that it is the squat’s collective/inhabitants as a group who are contributing the information, and not a single person.
